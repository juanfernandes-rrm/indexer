Construction on Affinity Place began in May 2009 to replace Estevanâ€™s aging Civic Auditorium.[1] The project was finished in 2011. The first event for the $23.5 million facility,[2] initially named Spectra Place, was held on April 15, 2011 with a concert featuring Tom Cochrane and Kim Mitchell. [3]

The arena was renamed to Affinity Place in 2013. [4]

The venue has hosted various sporting events, like curling, hockey and mixed martial arts, along with a series of concerts.

Notable hockey events hosted at Affinity Place include the 2016 Western Canada Cup and the 2022 Centennial Cup.

The venue became the first to host both the SaskTel Tankard and the Saskatchewan Scotties Tournament of Hearts in the same year in 2023. [5]
